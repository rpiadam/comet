Scope of this document
======================

This document describes the commands and functions available to
operators in the FoxComet IRCd.

This document, and various ideas for features, have been taken from
dancer-ircd/hyperion (the IRCd used on freenode, mainly written by Andrew
Suffield and Jilles Tjoelker), as well as from Charybdis and solanum.

While this document may be of some interest to users of FoxComet servers,
it is intended as a reference for network staff and IRC operators.

FoxComet is based on solanum and Charybdis, which in turn was based on
ircd-ratbox. While much has changed over the years, many of the operator
commands and concepts remain similar to those found in earlier IRC daemons.

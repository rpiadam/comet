CHATHISTORY <channel> <query-type> [timestamp] [limit]

CHATHISTORY allows you to query message history for channels
that have history enabled (mode +H).

Query types:
  LATEST [limit]     - Get the latest messages (default: 50, max: 100)
  AROUND <timestamp> [limit] - Get messages around a specific timestamp
  BEFORE <timestamp> [limit] - Get messages before a timestamp
  AFTER <timestamp> [limit]  - Get messages after a timestamp

Examples:
  CHATHISTORY #channel LATEST 20
  CHATHISTORY #channel AROUND 1234567890 10
  CHATHISTORY #channel BEFORE 1234567890

Note: This command requires the draft/chathistory capability and
the channel must have history mode (+H) enabled.

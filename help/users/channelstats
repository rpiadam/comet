CHANNELSTATS <channel>

CHANNELSTATS displays detailed statistics about a channel:
  - Member breakdown (total, ops, halfops, voices, regular)
  - Ban list counts (bans, exceptions, invite exceptions, quiets)
  - Channel age (time since creation)
  - Topic age (time since topic was last set)

This provides more detailed information than CHANINFO.

Example:
  CHANNELSTATS #channel

You must be a member of the channel to use this command
(unless you are an IRC operator).

CHANACCESS <channel> [type]

CHANACCESS displays the access list for a channel, showing all
members with their status prefixes (@ for ops, % for halfops,
+ for voices).

Optional type parameter filters the list:
  ops      - Show only channel operators
  halfops  - Show only halfops
  voices   - Show only voiced users
  regular  - Show only regular members (no status)
  all      - Show all members (default)

Examples:
  CHANACCESS #channel
  CHANACCESS #channel ops
  CHANACCESS #channel voices

You must be a member of the channel to use this command
(unless you are an IRC operator).
